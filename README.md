# -XXt-CanBeFaster

This repository contains a placeholder implementation related to the
paper "$XX^t$ Can Be Faster". The original paper is included as
`2505.09814v1.pdf` but no official code was provided. The script
`xx_fast.py` demonstrates how to compute the Gram matrix `X X^T` in
pure Python using nested loops.

To run the example:

```bash
python3 xx_fast.py
```

The script generates a small random matrix and outputs its Gram matrix.
